# Howdy ðŸ¤ 
I'm Parmesan Linguine. I write code from time to time, mostly working on small projects, although programming has become more of an "I'm bored and don't feel like doing anything else" hobby. Sometimes I'll get a burst of motivation to work on a project, which you can probably see reflected in my GitHub activity. 

I typically use **C#** (I absolutely adore the language and its flexibility), although I am more than capable of writing code in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Python** (probably with a bit (lot) of consulting documentation) and have experience using **Java** and **HTML/CSS**. Other languages that I would like to learn at some point include **F#**, **Rust**, and **C++**, but I do not have a particular need for them right now. In that regard, I adhere fairly strictly to YAGNI.

## Projects
### Monkebot
Monkebot is a fun Discord bot that will periodically join your voice chats and play monkey noises. Yes, the idea is childish. But hey, it's been added to over [4,500 servers at the time of writing](https://dblstatistics.com/bot/771124545544781824)!

The bot is written in C# using the [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) library for Discord communication, and [Lavalink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink) for audio playback. The code is currently kept in closed source, with no plans to open source the C# implementation before it stops being hosted.

If you'd like to add the bot to your Discord server, or would simply like to learn more about it, visit the [Top.gg listing](https://top.gg/bot/771124545544781824) or [join the support server](https://parm.dev/monke/support).

### Plang
Plang (short for **P**armesan **Lang**uage â€” creative, I know) is my first attempt at creating a programming language, from its design to an actual compiler implentation. Currently, it is being implemented in **Python** using **LLVM**. Being my first go at implementing a language, the code is horrendously messy. There'll be plenty of time to fix it once it works.

Despite my relatively little experience using different programming languages, I hold some fairly strong opinions on their design. Plang seeks to incorporate elements from both functional and imperative programming languages, enabling developers coming from imperative languages to be able to benefit from some of the wonderful sides of the functional world without necessarily diving straight into a functional-first language. I'm particularly fond of the concept of developers having to explicitly mark and handle side effects in functions, although if I'm being honest I have no clue how it would look being implemented in the language. It's a project for fun, not a language that's meant for any serious use. And, let's be real â€” it ain't ever getting finished.

## Interests
Currently, I'm interested in the fields of **language design and compiler implementation** as well as **game development**.

Outside of programming, I enjoy playing video games, and have a strong passion for music. I have a piano and guitar, and have experience playing both bassoon and tenor saxophone through our school's band. Ultimately, I'd like to release an album at some point. Long way to go.
